1) How would you rate (1-10) the difficulty level of the test (1 = really easy, 10 = impossible)?

2) Was the timit limit (7,5 hours) ok or too strict?

3) Other feedback about the test?


1. 8
2. 7.5 should be fine for this task
3. Would be better a little less text in description to the task but more strict. Got a little confused. But it might be my own problem since I have read it first quite fast.
